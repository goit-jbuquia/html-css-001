      Wyatt resteth here, that quick could never rest;
      Whose heavenly gifts increased by disdain,
      And virtue sank the deeper in his breast;
      Such profit he by envy could obtain.

      A head where wisdom mysteries did frame,
      Whose hammers beat still in that lively brain
      As on a stithy where that some work of fame
      Was daily wrought, to turn to Britain's gain.
